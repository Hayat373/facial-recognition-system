# Facial Recognition System

A web-based facial recognition system built with Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow, and Flask. Designed for applications like security or social media tagging, this project enables users to capture face images, train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to recognize faces, and identify individuals in real-time via a webcam through a Flask-based web interface.
